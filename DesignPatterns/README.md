It sounds like you're referring to a **"Flying Design Pattern."** However, no established design pattern by that name exists in traditional software design principles like the **Gang of Four (GoF)** or other widely recognized software architectures.

### Possible Interpretations:
1. **Flight-Related Design Pattern (Aviation, Drones, or AR/VR)**  
   - If you're talking about software architecture for drones, flight simulations, or autonomous flying systems, the pattern may involve **state machines**, **strategy patterns**, or **event-driven architecture** for managing flight controls.
  
2. **"Flyweight" Design Pattern**  
   - This is a real software design pattern from **GoF**, used to **minimize memory usage** by **sharing objects** instead of creating multiple instances. It is commonly used in rendering systems (e.g., game engines, fonts, UI elements).
  
3. **"Flying" as a Metaphor for Agile or Dynamic Patterns**  
   - Maybe you're looking for **a flexible, dynamic design pattern** that adapts **on the fly** to changing conditions (like adaptive algorithms, behavior trees, or reactive programming).

Could you clarify what exactly you mean by "Flying Design Pattern"? Are you referring to a specific use case or industry? ðŸš€
