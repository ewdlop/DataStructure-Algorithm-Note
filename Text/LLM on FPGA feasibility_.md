# **Implementing a 70 Billion Parameter LLM in a 64-bit FPGA**

Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing with their ability to understand and generate human-like text. However, deploying these massive models, especially those with tens of billions of parameters, presents significant challenges in terms of computational resources and power consumption. While GPUs have been the dominant hardware platform for LLM inference, FPGAs are emerging as a potential alternative, offering advantages in terms of energy efficiency and customization. This is particularly relevant as the field explores the use of embedded FPGAs for LLM acceleration, given their energy efficiency and suitability for edge devices1. This article explores the feasibility and challenges of implementing a 70 billion parameter LLM in a 64-bit FPGA, examining the limitations, optimization techniques, and potential benefits of this approach.

## **Challenges of Implementing LLMs on FPGAs**

Implementing large LLMs on FPGAs is not without its hurdles. Some key challenges include:

* **Limited Resources:** FPGAs, especially those designed for embedded systems, often have limited memory capacity and bandwidth compared to the demands of large LLMs. A 70 billion parameter model, even with quantization, requires substantial memory to store model weights and activations. For instance, a 70B parameter LLM quantized to 4-bit precision requires 3.5GB of memory just for the model weights, not including the memory needed for the key-value cache, which further increases memory requirements2.  
* **Computational Efficiency:** Efficiently mapping the complex operations of an LLM onto the FPGA fabric requires careful optimization to maximize resource utilization and minimize latency3.  
* **Memory Bandwidth Bottlenecks:** The memory bandwidth of FPGAs can be a bottleneck, especially during the decode stage of LLM inference, where the model needs to access large amounts of data from memory3.  
* **Compilation Overheads:** Compiling large LLM models for FPGA implementation can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially for dynamic sparsity patterns and varying input lengths3.  
* **Model Size and Performance Trade-off:** As LLMs increase in size, their performance in terms of inference throughput and energy consumption can be affected. Larger models generally require more computational resources and consume more power, which can be a limiting factor for FPGA deployments4.

To illustrate this trade-off, consider the following figure from 4:

## **Optimization Techniques for Deploying LLMs on FPGAs**

To overcome these challenges, various optimization techniques have been developed:

* **Model Compression:** Techniques like pruning and quantization can significantly reduce the size of the LLM, making it more manageable for FPGA deployment. Quantization involves reducing the precision of model weights and activations, while pruning removes less important connections in the network3.  
* **Efficient Hardware Architectures:** Designing specialized hardware architectures within the FPGA can improve computational efficiency. This includes optimizing matrix multiplication operations, which are fundamental to LLMs, and utilizing on-chip memory effectively3.  
  Furthermore, it's crucial to consider the different architectural paradigms for FPGA-based LLM accelerators. These include:  
  * **Temporal Architecture:** In this approach, a single processing engine is reused for different layers and models. This offers flexibility but can lead to increased off-chip memory access and higher latency5.  
  * **Spatial Architecture:** This involves creating dedicated hardware units for specific layers or operations, enabling direct on-chip communication and potentially higher efficiency. However, this approach can be less flexible and may require more complex design5.

The choice between these architectures depends on the specific LLM model, the desired performance, and the constraints of the FPGA device.

* **Memory Bandwidth Optimization:** Techniques like data reuse and memory access pattern optimization can alleviate memory bandwidth bottlenecks3.  
* **Compilation Optimization:** Tools and techniques for optimizing the compilation process can reduce compilation time and resource usage3.  
  One such technique is High-Level Synthesis (HLS), which allows developers to design and implement LLM accelerators using higher-level programming languages like C++ instead of traditional hardware description languages. This can significantly simplify the design process and reduce development time5.

It's important to note that these optimization techniques are often interconnected and need to be applied in a coordinated manner to achieve the best results. For example, model compression can reduce memory requirements, which in turn can alleviate memory bandwidth bottlenecks and enable the use of more efficient hardware architectures. Similarly, HLS can simplify the design of specialized hardware units that are optimized for the compressed model.

Moreover, when designing FPGA accelerators for LLMs, it's essential to consider the different stages of LLM inference:

* **Prefill Stage:** This stage involves processing the initial input prompt, which can be parallelized to some extent6.  
* **Decode Stage:** This stage involves generating the output text token by token, which is inherently sequential and often memory-intensive6.

These stages have different computational and memory access patterns, and FPGAs can be tailored to address these specific needs. For example, the prefill stage might benefit from parallel processing units, while the decode stage might require optimized memory access and buffering strategies.

## **Current State-of-the-art in Deploying LLMs on FPGAs**

Recent advancements have shown promising results in deploying LLMs on FPGAs. Some notable examples include:

* **TerEffic:** This FPGA-based accelerator utilizes ternary quantization and on-chip memory to achieve significant performance and efficiency gains compared to GPUs4.  
* **FlightLLM:** This system leverages FPGA-specific resources like DSP blocks and heterogeneous memory hierarchy to optimize computation and memory usage for LLM inference8.  
* **GLITCHES:** This heterogeneous system combines GPUs and FPGAs to address the different computational bottlenecks in the prefill and decode stages of LLM inference6.

These examples demonstrate the potential of FPGAs for accelerating LLM inference, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

## **Limitations of Implementing LLMs on FPGAs**

While FPGAs offer several advantages, it's important to acknowledge their limitations:

* **Program and Memory Capacity:** FPGAs may not be able to accommodate the large programs and memory required by massive LLMs, especially those with tens of billions of parameters9.  
* **Cost-Effectiveness for Ternary Inference:** While FPGAs can be effective for accelerating LLMs with low-bitwidth quantization, GPUs with their specialized instructions (like BMMA for Int1 tensor operations) and large VRAM might be more cost-effective for ternary LLM inference9.

These limitations highlight the need for careful consideration and optimization when deploying LLMs on FPGAs.

## **Potential Benefits of Using FPGAs for LLM Inference**

FPGAs offer several potential benefits for LLM inference:

* **Energy Efficiency:** FPGAs can be more energy-efficient than GPUs, especially for specific tasks and workloads. This can be crucial for edge deployments and data centers where power consumption is a major concern10.  
* **Customization:** The reconfigurable nature of FPGAs allows for customization and optimization for specific LLM architectures and tasks. This can lead to improved performance and reduced latency compared to general-purpose GPUs10.  
* **Low Latency:** FPGAs can deliver lower and more predictable latency than GPUs, which is important for real-time applications like voice assistants and interactive AI systems11.  
* **Cost-Effectiveness:** While the upfront cost of FPGAs can be higher than GPUs, their energy efficiency and longer lifespan can result in lower total cost of ownership over time11.  
* **Support for Low-bitwidth Quantization and Sparsity:** FPGAs can efficiently support low-bitwidth quantization and sparsity techniques, which can further improve the efficiency of LLM inference. These techniques can reduce memory requirements and computational complexity, leading to lower power consumption and higher throughput5.

## **Cost and Power Consumption Considerations**

The cost of using FPGAs for LLM inference can vary depending on the specific FPGA device and the complexity of the model. High-end FPGAs with large memory capacity and bandwidth can be expensive. However, the cost can be offset by the potential energy savings and performance gains. For example, FlightLLM on FPGAs achieved 1.8x better cost efficiency than GPUs12.

Power consumption is another important consideration. While FPGAs are often touted as being more energy-efficient than GPUs, it's crucial to remember that their actual power consumption can vary significantly. Factors that influence power usage include the specific FPGA model, the utilization of its resources, and the design of the implemented logic. Power consumption can range from milliwatts to over 100 watts14.

## **Conclusion**

Implementing a 70 billion parameter LLM in a 64-bit FPGA is a challenging but increasingly feasible endeavor. Advancements in optimization techniques and hardware architectures are paving the way for efficient and energy-efficient LLM inference on FPGAs. While challenges remain in terms of resource limitations, particularly memory capacity and compilation overheads, the potential benefits of FPGAs, such as energy efficiency, customization, and low latency, make them a compelling alternative to GPUs for deploying large LLMs.

The feasibility of this approach depends on several factors, including the specific FPGA device, the LLM architecture, and the desired performance. Careful consideration of the trade-offs between model size, performance, and power consumption is crucial. Optimization techniques like model compression, efficient hardware architectures, and memory bandwidth optimization play a vital role in enabling efficient LLM deployment on FPGAs.

Looking ahead, further research and development in areas like HLS-based design, low-bitwidth quantization, and sparsity exploitation will be crucial in unlocking the full potential of FPGAs for LLM inference. As the field progresses, we can expect to see more efficient and cost-effective solutions for deploying large LLMs on FPGAs, especially in resource-constrained environments and real-time applications.
