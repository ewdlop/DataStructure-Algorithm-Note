# DataStructureNote

## Overview
This project is a collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in C#. It includes various data structures such as graphs, inverted indexes, ropes, and more. The project also provides implementations of common algorithms like bubble sort.

## Data Structures and Algorithms
### Data Structures
- **Graph**: A class representing a graph data structure with methods to add vertices, add edges, display the graph, and invert the graph.
- **Inverted Index**: A class representing an inverted index, which is used to map terms to the documents that contain them.
- **Rope**: A class representing a rope data structure, which is a binary tree used to store and manipulate strings efficiently.

### Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort**: An implementation of the bubble sort algorithm with various extension methods for sorting collections.
